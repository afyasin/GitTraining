Git created by Linus Torvalds - same as linux
Commits are saves of the code to Git system

git diff commitid1 commitid2 --> give us the changes just like diff -u file1 file2

git log --stat --> give a log of commits and changes. It'll also show ll the files the commit changed
git log --> gives a shorter version of the above

git clone <url> --> clones the entire repository (files and change logs) to your machine
Seems it clones onto your folder

git checkout <commit_id> --> reverts the file to that version. Many uses e.g. checking to see when a bug was introduced

git init --> doing this in a directory makes it a git repository. A .git file will be added.

git status --> gives details about the last commit

git add <file> --> adds files to the repository

git commit -m "Commit Message" --> Commits the addition to the repository
