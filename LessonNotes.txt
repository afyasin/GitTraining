Git created by Linus Torvalds - same as linux
Commits are saves of the code to Git system

git diff commitid1 commitid2 --> give us the changes just like diff -u file1 file2

git log --stat --> give a log of commits and changes. It'll also show ll the files the commit changed
git log --> gives a shorter version of the above

git clone <url> --> clones the entire repository (files and change logs) to your machine
Seems it clones onto your folder

git checkout <commit_id> --> reverts the file to that version. Many uses e.g. checking to see when a bug was introduced

git init --> doing this in a directory makes it a git repository. A .git file will be added.

git status --> gives details about the last commit

git add <file> --> adds files to the repository

git commit -m "Commit Message" --> Commits the addition to the repository

All files are int he Working directory. When you do "git add", they're added to the staging area. When you "commit", they're added to the repository.

git diff --> compares working directory versions to Staging area versions.

git diff --staged   --> compares staging area versions to the repository versions.

git reset --hard  --> irreversible discarding of changes in working directory and staging area.
